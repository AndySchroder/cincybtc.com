#### Discussion Follow Up

- [BOLT11.org](https://www.bolt11.org/) does not explicitly show the public key of the payee in an invoice, but it can be "recovered" from the signature [see BOLT11](https://github.com/lightning/bolts/blob/master/11-payment-encoding.md).  
- [lightningdecoder.com](https://lightningdecoder.com/) does explicitly recover the public key of the payee in an invoice, but it doesn't show where it came from in the invoice.
